# mern-book-search-engine

## Description:

This application is a Google Book Engine that helps users to search for books.  A user can search for a book by typing in a book title and the application will return
a list of books listing the book title, an image of the book cover, the author's name (if available), and the book description (if available).  A registered user who is
logged in is able to also add books to a personal book list that can be retrieved at anytime in the future.  The user can remove a book from the book list at anytime.

## Technologies Use:

This application was originally written using RESTful API and the goal of this project was to refactor the code to use Graphql API.  The application is built with the MERN
stack, Apollo Server, Apollo Provider, Express.js, MongoDB, Node, and React.
